# Academia Mentor Trust

Academia Mentor Trust is a platform designed to help PhD students make informed decisions about choosing potential advisors. It connects PhD applicants with experienced PhD graduates who can offer insights and share their experiences with specific supervisors, fostering a culture of trust, mentorship, and community in academia.

## Motivation

The relationship between a PhD student and their advisor is one of the most significant factors influencing the success and well-being of a student's academic journey. With the increasing pressures of academia—such as publishing demands, grant-seeking, and administrative burdens—traditional mentorship relationships have sometimes shifted away from their original purpose. 

Academia Mentor Trust was founded on the belief that **mentorship in academia should remain a guiding and supportive process**, where experienced scholars help guide new PhD candidates not only in their research but also in navigating the professional, technical, and social aspects of academic life. 

This platform seeks to fill a gap where PhD candidates can **confidentially assess potential supervisors**, beyond just reading publications or institutional profiles, by having real conversations with former students. The goal is to foster a **community-driven approach** to maintaining the integrity of academic mentorship, helping ensure that new generations of scholars receive the support and guidance they need to thrive.

## Features

- **Connect with Experienced PhDs**: PhD applicants can search for supervisors and connect with graduates who have first-hand experience with those advisors.
- **Confidential Conversations**: All interactions between PhD applicants and mentors are confidential, promoting open and honest discussions.
- **Manual Vetting**: Data providers (experienced PhDs) are manually vetted to ensure they have a genuine academic relationship with the supervisor they are discussing.
- **Mentorship Culture**: The platform encourages professional friendship and informal mentorship between participants.

## How It Works

1. **PhD Applicants**: Sign up, search for a supervisor by name, and request a conversation with an experienced PhD who has knowledge of the supervisor.
2. **Experienced PhDs (Data Providers)**: Sign up and submit verification materials to confirm your relationship with a supervisor. Once vetted, you can be contacted by PhD applicants seeking guidance.
3. **Vetting Process**: Each data provider is manually vetted by administrators to ensure authenticity, using materials like publications, personal websites, or professional IDs.
